# Module Design and Organization Guidelines

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles

When designing and organizing modules in a Laravel application, it's important to adhere to the following DDD principles:

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: Use a common language that bridges the gap between technical and domain-specific terminology.
2. **Bounded Context**: Divide your application into distinct bounded contexts, each with its own set of models, services, and repositories.
3. **Aggregates**: Identify aggregates, which are consistency boundaries within your domain, and design modules around them.
4. **Domain Events**: Emphasize the use of domain events to capture and communicate domain-specific changes.
5. **Repositories**: Isolate data persistence concerns within repositories that abstract database operations.
6. **Services**: Implement domain logic within services that orchestrate interactions between models and repositories.
7. **Value Objects**: Use value objects to encapsulate small, self-contained pieces of data with their own behavior.
8. **Entities**: Represent objects with identity and mutable state as entities.
9. **Domain Services**: Implement domain-specific operations that don't naturally fit into entities or value objects.

## Module Structure

Follow this structure when designing and organizing modules in a Laravel application:

- `app`
  - `Modules`
    - `{ModuleName}`
      - `Domain`
        - `Models`: Define the domain models specific to the module.
        - `Services`: Implement the domain logic and interaction between models and repositories.
        - `ValueObjects`: Define value objects encapsulating specific behaviors and data.
        - `Events`: Capture and dispatch domain events within the module.
        - `Exceptions`: Handle exceptions specific to the module.
      - `Infrastructure`
        - `Repositories`: Implement interfaces for data persistence and encapsulate database operations.
        - `Providers`: Register services and bindings specific to the module.
      - `UI`
        - `Http`
          - `Controllers`: Handle HTTP requests and delegate work to the domain services.
          - `Requests`: Validate and authorize incoming requests using form request objects.
          - `Resources`: Transform models into appropriate representations for API responses.
          - `Routes`: Define module-specific routes.
        - `Console`
          - `Commands`: Implement console commands related to the module.
      - `Tests`: Write unit tests, integration tests, and feature tests specific to the module.
      - `Database`: Migrations and seeders specific to the module.
    - `{AnotherModuleName}`
      - Repeat the above structure for each additional module.
