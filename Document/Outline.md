## Domain Entities:
1. Create a folder for each module under the `app/Modules` directory.
2. Inside each module folder, create an `Entities` directory to store the domain entities.
3. Define each domain entity as a PHP class with properties and methods that represent the entity's behavior.
4. Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to keep entities focused on their core responsibilities.

## Aggregates:
1. Within the `Entities` directory, create an `Aggregates` directory to store aggregate root entities.
2. Define aggregate root entities as PHP classes that encapsulate related domain entities and define consistency boundaries.
3. Implement methods in the aggregate root to enforce business rules and manage interactions between its contained entities.

## Value Objects:
1. Create a `ValueObjects` directory within the `Entities` directory to store value objects.
2. Value objects should be immutable and represent a single concept in the domain.
3. Implement value objects as PHP classes with properties and methods that define their behavior.
4. Overload comparison operators to facilitate equality comparisons.

## Repositories:
1. Within each module, create a `Repositories` directory to store repository interfaces and their implementations.
2. Define repository interfaces that specify methods for data access and manipulation specific to the module's entities.
3. Implement repository classes that interact with the underlying data storage (e.g., a database) and provide data persistence.

## Services:
1. Create a `Services` directory within each module to store domain services.
2. Domain services encapsulate complex domain logic that doesn't fit well within a single entity or value object.
3. Implement services as PHP classes with methods that perform specific domain operations.
4. Inject necessary repositories or other services into the domain services.

## Application Layer Logic:
1. Create an `Http` directory within each module to handle HTTP requests and responses.
2. Implement controllers to handle HTTP endpoints and route requests to the appropriate services or repositories.
3. Use Laravel's routing mechanism to map URLs to controller methods.
4. Validate incoming requests using Laravel's validation features.
5. Leverage Laravel's middleware to implement cross-cutting concerns like authentication or authorization.

This outline provides a basic structure for organizing your code within a module-based architecture using Laravel. Keep in mind that these are general best practices, and you may need to adapt them to suit your specific project requirements.
